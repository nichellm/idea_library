          <h3>Sample Summary</h3>


          <p>Making business decisions on where to allocate human resources or critical needs of a business organization are
              best highlighted using business intelligence measures or data analytics. Below are some examples of big data manipulated in Tableau
               from ServiceNow to showcase a quarterly review of program area performance. </p>
          
<h4>FY21 Q2 ServiceNow Report</h4>
<p>
<ol type="I">
  <h4 id="p1"> 
<li> SUMMARY </h4>
<ol type="A">
 <br><li>Quarter Comparison 
 <ol type="1">

  <br><li>To begin the ticket analysis for this quarter, BMB compared the number of open and closed tickets for FY21 Q2 to the
     same quarter in the previous fiscal year and found that this quarter was busier than a year ago.  The data shows for 
     Q2 of FY21, the total number of tickets opened increased by 24%, with the largest number of tickets being opened by FBC 
     employees. Similarly, the total number of tickets closed in FY21 Q2 increase by 11%, with the largest number of these being 
     submitted by FBC. This increase experienced in this second quarter compared to last year’s second quarter can largely be 
     attributed to the change in the work environment induced by the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020.  </ol><br>

   <li>Average Days Open    
   <ol type="1">
  <br><li>As of March 31, 2021, the average days open for active tickets reduced from 34 days to 
    27 days from the previous quarter this fiscal year. A large part played by the Space and Facilities Branch 
    (SFMB) who went from 643 days open to 5 days for a decrease of 99.2%. Most of these ticket closures took place 
    in the first month of the second quarter for this branch.
    <li>In January for SFMB, 872 requests were closed compared
     to 629 in February, and 585 in March. The Lease Acquisition Administration Branch (LAAB) and the Personal 
     Property Management Branch (PPMB) also experienced a reduction in their active days but less significantly. 
     LAAB went from an average of 50 days that tickets remained open to 29; PPMB went from an average of 15 days open to 
     8 days. Conversely, the Business Management Branch (BMB) increased from 31 days to 48 days due to a series of seven 
     budget requests that had been open more than 45 days (Tickets referenced: INT0108135, INT0117391, INT0124708, INT0128262, 
     INT0128321, INT0133486, INT0135069). The Directives, Forms, and Records Management Branch (DFRMB) similarly had an 
     increase in open days from 38 days to 46 days, two tickets of which had been open 394 days (tickets reference: 
     INT0061067, and INT0069111).</ol><br>
  
    
  <li>Conclusion 

    <ol type="1">
  <br><li>Compared to FY21 Q1, MSD outperformed in processing requests. Emphasis on utilizing the notified customer box in 
    ServiceNow is required since more requests were closed without checking the box. Employees should acknowledge receipt of the
     tickets by checking the box within 2 days of the creation of the ticket. Red tickets experienced an increase from 
     the previous quarter. Please note that red requests from the previous quarter that have not been closed have rolled 
     over into this quarter’s data, and that three red tickets reported last quarter have been active more than one year.
  </ol><br>
     
<li>Data Analysis Notes    
  
  <ol type="1">
  <br><li>This report was calculated using a combination of direct excel exports from ServiceNow dated March 31, 2021, and compiled
     data from the weekly Green, Amber, and Red (GAR).  The following is a list of important key terms used in this report: 
    •	Opened: Incorporates tickets opened between FY21 Q2, exported directly from ServiceNow.
    •	Average Days Open: Computed using tickets in Work in status as of 
    March 31, 2021. This includes tickets opened from previous fiscal years, three of which are more than a year old. 
    •	Closed: These tickets have a FY21 closed date but may have been opened in a previous fiscal year. The total number of closed 
    tickets are broken out in “resolved request” columns by agency.
    •	“Non-Mission Area” resolved request: These tickets are open requests where the “agency” field for the customer is blank or 
    for agencies not in our mission area.
  </ol>

<br>
<h4 id="p2"> 
<li>PROCESSING TIME</h4>
  <ol type="1">
<br><li>
  MSD has an average processing time of 10 business days. Processing times is the delta of the open date and the close date, which excludes 
  non-business and holidays. BMB, DFRMB, and LAAB experienced similar trends in the second quarter, in which they had a higher processing time 
  average in January, which then decreased in February, and then increased again in March. Whereas SFMB drastically reduced their processing time 
  from January to February and remained at that level going into March. PPMB is the only branch that reduced their processing time each month, 
  although slightly, as they had the lowest processing time to begin with. These trends can be attributed to both the workflow of incoming
  tickets and the types of tickets that are closed; tickets that require more time to process affect the average processing time when they 
  are closed because they have been open longer.
   </ol>
  
   <h4 id="p3"> 
 <br> <li>COMPARISON METRICS</h4>
 <br>
  <ol type="1">
  <br><li>FY20 Q2 highlights that more requests were completed than opened by customers in FY21 Q2, showing the impact of the global pandemic 
  and subsequent change in operations. Tickets being opened and closed in FY21 Q2, seem to be reverting to their normal trend of FY19 
  in having more tickets are being opened at the time of tickets being closed or completed.  
  
 <li>Regarding requests from landlords of service centers (considered external customers), consistent help is needed for correcting payment 
  issues and landlords needing guidance on the lease renewal process. Releasing more information or a memo to landlords regarding the 
  process for beginning lease renewal or change of ownership would be advantageous for customers who initiate tickets requesting information only. 
  </ol><br>
  <note> <strong> Note: </strong>Anomalies in ServiceNow ticket reporting occurred during the second quarter resulting in 
    duplicate closed tickets. Those have been excluded from the report as well as canceled 
    tickets. </note>
  <br>
  <h4 id="p4"> 
<li> OPEN TICKETS</h4>

 <br><li>TOP 3 RED TICKETS BY SUBCATEGORY </h4>
  <ol type="A">
  <br><li>Explanation of Open vs Benchmark in Delta Graph
    <ol type="1">
  <br><li>Processing Time: To calculate processing time for work in progress or open tickets, the last 
    day of Q2 was used. 
  
 <l1> Delta: The delta represents the number of days that exceeded the end cap set for the amber 
  status parameter. The monthly count is the average days those subcategories were in 
  progress using the closed and active status. For active tickets, the days past benchmark 
  were calculated using March 31st for the end date. For closed tickets, the actual 
  closed date was used. The Building Issues parameter was increased from 43 days 
  to 120 days towards the end of Q2.	</ol>
  <ol type="A">
  <br><li>Unique Reds Compared to FY21 Q1 Per Branch
    <ol type="1">
  <br><li>The monthly comparison graphics on slides 9-18 includes tickets that are designated as red in each of those months. Please note that 
  if a ticket is red in January and remains open in February it would be counted as a red ticket for each of those months. The total reds 
  are counted from the work in progress and closed reds for each branch in each month within the quarter. The following is information on 
  the unique count of tickets that were in the status of red this FY21 Q2.  Compared to the previous quarter BMB increased from 2 reds to 
  7 reds; DFRMB reduced from 114 reds to 88 reds; LAAB increased from 37 reds to 49 reds; PPMB increased from 6 reds to 15 reds; SFMB decreased 
  from 88 reds to 19 reds.
